# wellness_app
## A two day project 
#### SYNTHESIS 
This little project took me about two  days, the first day was setting up the twilio CLI and the API for the sms. 
At first i worked on a prototype to learn how to set up the API, once i had set up the API. And build a tkinter barebones GUI to launch sms texts. 

This project was themed around the idea of of a wellness tracker. I want an app that i can trackdown a small number of tasks and have data persistance through a database. Another aspect that I wanted was that it would send sms texts to my personal cellphone. (p.s. i have a poor mental health so that is why i wanted this app)

My next goal is to find a way to add the software into hardware, a tablet to be precise. Obviously Apple is out of the question. And i can't code for android. 

#### So how do i want to put it in a tablet? 
I am considering an android Onn tablet, for their size. But more importantly due to the App UserLAnd which would allow me to run a Linux distro. I've been experimenting with my pixel, just to learn how to set it up. And i am confident that i could run the app on Android. 

#### This app is a combination of all my knowledge I've aqcuired during COVID. 
Covid started and i decided to finally bear down and start learning how to code, through these months I learned basic python. Mainly OOP, the basic syntax and such. 
As well as tkinter, and slowly Ive learned sqlite3. 

#### Although i struggle a lot with insecurity due to being so new in this field
I was able to program this app mostly through my own knowledge, with some minimal look in Python Docs. Which makes me really happy. .
